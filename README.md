Introduction to the primaERP API
==

Current version: ~1.5.44

If you want to read / create / edit / delete your projects, clients, tasks or time records you can use the primaERP API.

primaERP API is built using the [RESTful architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restful) style, which provides full access to the main resources.

To access the API you will need an API KEY. Please send an email to [support@primaerp.com](mailto:support@primaerp.com) to get one!
